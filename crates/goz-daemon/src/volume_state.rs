//! The index lives behind a `parking_lot::RwLock`: the volume's tail thread
//! takes the write lock for micro-batches of journal updates, while pipe-server

//! `Send` but not `Sync`): it is moved into the tail thread, so `VolumeState`
//! stays `Sync` and can be shared across the tokio runtime via `Arc`.
