//! Hard-link set enumeration: every name a file record currently has.
//!
//! A USN `HARD_LINK_CHANGE` record names exactly one link and may name a DEAD
//! one, so the index can never learn a file's real link set from the journal
//! alone. This asks the filesystem instead, and the daemon feeds the answer to
//! `goz_core::index::VolumeIndex::reconcile_links`.
//!
//! Cost is paid only when a hard-link change actually arrives, which is rare,
//! and the caller runs it with the index write lock RELEASED: like `stat_file`,
//! these are blocking file opens and must never sit inside the lock every query
//! contends on.
//!
//! Returns raw UTF-16 exactly as Win32 gave it. NTFS names can contain unpaired
//! surrogates, so decoding is left to `goz-core`'s WTF-8 layer rather than being
//! lossily flattened here.
