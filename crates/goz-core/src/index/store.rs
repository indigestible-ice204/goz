//!
//! Names are INTERNED: only ~31% of the names on a real Windows volume are
//! unique (node_modules alone contributes tens of thousands of copies of
//! `index.js`), so each distinct name is stored once and every entry carries a
//! 4-byte [`NameId`]. Entries sharing a name are linked through a doubly-linked
//! same-name chain (`next_same` / `prev_same` columns, head in the store), which
//! is how a query scan hit over the deduplicated haystack expands back into
//! entries. The chains are kept EXACT (eager O(1) unlink on tombstone), never
//! lazily repaired: a stale singly-linked chain can cycle through reused slots,
//! and an exact chain needs no per-candidate staleness guard at query time.
