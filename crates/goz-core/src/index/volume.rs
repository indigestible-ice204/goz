//! The per-volume index and the rules that mutate it.
//!
//! [`VolumeIndex`] owns the entry table, name arena, and FRN map, and applies
//! USN ops and FILE_LAYOUT enrichment to them. The invariants it upholds:
//!
//! - Paths are never stored. They are rebuilt on demand by walking parent
//!   links, which makes a directory rename O(1): renaming a directory touches
//!   exactly its own entry, and every descendant's path is correct on the next
//!   reconstruction.
//! - Every op is idempotent. USN reason bits accumulate per open-close window,
//!   so the same logical change reappears; applying a batch twice equals
//!   applying it once.
//! - Orphans are never dropped. An unknown parent becomes a placeholder under
//!   lost+found, filled in when the parent's real record arrives.
//! - Slot reuse can never alias. The FRN map is keyed by record number and
//!   every hit is re-checked against the full FRN (sequence included).
