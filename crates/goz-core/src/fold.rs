//! Case folding for case-insensitive matching.
//!
//! Two tiers: an ASCII fast path (`A..=Z` → `+0x20`) and, for non-ASCII,
//! canonical decomposition, a simple 1:1 Unicode lowercase of each scalar (the
//! first scalar of `char::to_lowercase`), then canonical RECOMPOSITION. NFD makes the same text fold
//! identically whether it arrived precomposed (NFC, `é` = U+00E9) or decomposed
//! (NFD, `e` + U+0301): a filename copied from macOS matches a query
//! typed on Windows. Combining marks are KEPT, so unifying the normalization
//! form never merges genuinely distinct letters (Cyrillic `й` stays distinct
//! from `и`); accent-insensitivity is deliberately NOT done here. The result is
//! close to, but not identical to, NTFS's own `$UpCase` comparison: `$UpCase` is
//! a per-code-unit table and does not normalize, so goz additionally treats NFC
//! and NFD spellings of the same text as equal (any precomposed letter with a
//! canonical decomposition). Matching never affects index integrity. Both the
//! needle and each candidate name are folded with the same function, so
//! comparisons stay consistent.
//!
//! Input and output are WTF-8. Unpaired surrogates (code points `U+D800..=
//! U+DFFF`, which a real text needle can never contain) pass through
//! unchanged.
